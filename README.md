Real Time PHP
============

Before you al go like whatt?!
This is just a little expiriment i started in the train. I was thinking of a way to make PHP more realtime and more event based.

## What does it do?
Actualy at the moment
 - you can load in tasks
 - make the php file do stuff in loops
 - thats basicly it

     php console.php

Will sart your script.

Add tasks by putting them in the tasks folder, and put the data in the json.
I kinda have an idea for it : but i'm working it out first :D.

### How does it work?
Well simple: we have an endless php loop that checks if there is an updated key value in the .version file.
Meanwhile the loop has the possebility to w/e it wants, and when there is a key your task will be ran.

Some examples comming soon: probably better code comming soon ;)

have fun :)
